# DecentraStore

## 📝 Project Description
**DecentraStore** is a decentralized cloud storage management system built on Ethereum.  
It allows users to register, retrieve, and manage metadata for files stored on decentralized storage networks such as IPFS, Filecoin, or Arweave.

---

## 🌍 Project Vision
To empower individuals and developers with **privacy-focused**, **censorship-resistant**, and **fully decentralized** file management — enabling a future where data ownership remains with the user.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **File Registration:** Upload metadata (hash, name, size) for files stored on IPFS or any decentralized network.
- **Ownership Control:** Each file record belongs to its uploader.
- **Metadata Retrieval:** Quickly fetch file details by its hash.
- **File Deletion:** Owners can remove their uploaded file entries.
- **Event Logging:** Emits upload and deletion events for off-chain monitoring.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- **Token Incentives:** Introduce rewards for node storage or bandwidth contribution.
- **Access Control:** Add encryption keys or NFT-based file access.
- **Multi-Chain Support:** Integrate with Layer-2 and cross-chain storage systems.
- **Storage Proofs:** Implement Proof of Storage or Proof of Replication verification.
- **Frontend DApp:** Build a user interface for decentralized file uploads.
